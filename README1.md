# Albums Collection react-app

an app to manage albums.


## Salient Features
=>  Fetch and show albums from the api - <code>https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums</code><br>
=>  Add an album, make a POST call to the above url (from where you are fetching) and <br>
save the album in react state. (This will be a dummy request, you wonâ€™t be able to add albums to the server. <br>But the request is valid and will send you some data.).<br>
=>  Update the album, make a PUT call to the above url. (Again this is a dummy call).<br>
=>  Delete an album, make a DELETE call to the above url. (Again this is a dummy call).<br>
